# Village Kitchen

Village Kitchen is based on the idea that people love to cook and people love to eat home cooked meals.  The concept of Village Kitchen is to connect two interested parties within a given geography for a transaction.  It's never been easier to connect people than now and it's time for an app to allow the inner chef come out and feed the neighborhood!

## User Stories:
User should be able to come to the website and find meals available in their area.
User should have the option to review and buy different meals.
User should be able to create a "Cook" account where they can post their own meals and sell them.


### Technologies Used
For this project I used React front-end with a Python Flask back-end. 

For the front-end I used React Redux to manage state and pass the current user and/or cook around to different components.

For the back-end I used PostgresSQL relational database to tie users to a specific cook account and meals to their specific cook.
